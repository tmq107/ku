`ku` is short for **KU**bernetes. It is also the Norwegian word for cow.

A fast, keyboard-driven Kubernetes TUI. Browse any resource, read and edit
objects, follow logs, port-forward Services, and open a shell in a pod, without
leaving the terminal.

Looking for a mouse-driven Kubernetes UI? Try [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) or
[Headlamp](https://headlamp.dev/).

Inspired by k9s, Lens, and lazygit.

## Install

Install the latest release with the installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjarneo/ku/main/install.sh | sh
```

Or with Go:

```bash
go install github.com/bjarneo/ku@latest
```

Or from a clone:

```bash
make install   # builds and installs to ~/.local/bin, /usr/local/bin, or your last $PATH dir
go build -o ku .
```

Building from source requires Go 1.26.3+. Running ku requires a reachable
cluster.

## Quick start

```
ku                       # current context, remembered namespace
ku -n kube-system        # start in a namespace
ku --resource deploy     # start on a resource type
ku --theme tokyonight    # switch theme
ku --edit                # start in edit mode (default is read-only)
ku --dev                 # developer view, app resources only
ku upgrade               # replace the current binary with the latest release
```

Press `?` for help, `Ctrl+K` for the command palette, and `Shift+E` to toggle
edit mode.

## Modes

`ku` starts read-only. Every mutating or live access action is off: edit,
delete, rollout restart, scale, CronJob trigger, cordon, drain, shell into pods
or nodes, and Service port-forward. Read, describe, YAML, logs, and the
`kubectl` command preview still work. For all you fat-fingers out there, your
cluster is safe.

To make changes, press `Shift+E` or open the command palette (`Ctrl+K`) and pick
"Enter edit mode", then confirm the prompt. The header chip flips from a green
`● READ-ONLY` to a red `● EDIT`, and the mutating keys come back. Press
`Shift+E` again or pick "Return to read-only" to switch back. Pass `--edit` to
start in edit mode instead.

`--dev` switches to a developer view that hides cluster admin resources (nodes,
persistent volumes, storage classes, namespaces, events) and disables node
operations. CRD discovery is off too. Use it when you only manage your own app.
It composes with edit mode.

```
ku                       # read-only, full nav
ku --edit                # edit mode, full nav
ku --dev                 # read-only, developer view
ku --dev --edit          # edit mode, developer view
```

Disabled keys are dropped from the footer hints and the command palette, and `?`
summarizes the active mode.

## Configuration

`ku` reads an optional config file from `~/.config/ku/config.yaml` for sidebar
customization and stores session state in `~/.config/ku/state.json`.

### Add custom resources (CRDs) to the sidebar

The sidebar lists common built-in resources by default. CRDs are not shown until
you add them. Seed the config, then edit the `sidebar:` list:

```bash
ku config init     # write ~/.config/ku/config.yaml with the defaults
ku config path     # print the config file location
```

Add an item under any section (or a new one). The `resource` field accepts a
plural, singular, kind, short name, or group-qualified key. Use the
group-qualified form (`<plural>.<group>`) to avoid ambiguity:

```yaml
sidebar:
  - section: CRDs
    items:
      - { label: ScaledObjects, resource: scaledobjects.keda.sh }
      - { label: Certificates, resource: certificates.cert-manager.io }
      - { label: HPAs, resource: horizontalpodautoscalers }
```

Restart `ku` to apply the change. Resources your cluster does not expose are
dropped, and empty sections are hidden.

See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for the full reference.

## Highlights

- A cockpit overview on launch: cluster health, node CPU and memory gauges, pod and deployment status, and recent warnings.
- Server-rendered tables for any resource, the same columns as `kubectl get`, including CRDs.
- lazygit-style layout: a left resource nav, `Tab` between panes, and a status bar that always shows the keys that work right now.
- Config summaries, raw YAML, logs, Service port-forward, edit-in-editor, shell into pods or nodes, delete, scale, restart, and CronJob trigger, all inside the TUI.
- ANSI colors that match your terminal in light or dark mode, with Tokyo Night as a fallback (`--theme tokyonight`).
- A customizable sidebar menu via an optional config file (`ku config init`): add CRDs like HPAs, KEDA ScaledObjects, or OpenTelemetry collectors.
- `C` shows the equivalent `kubectl` command, and `O` opens upstream Kubernetes docs for known resources.
- Remembers your last context and namespace.
