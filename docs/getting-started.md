# Getting started

## Install

Install the latest release:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bjarneo/ku/main/install.sh | sh
```

Or install with Go:

```bash
go install github.com/bjarneo/ku@latest
```

Or build from a clone:

```
make install            # builds and installs to a bin dir on PATH
go build -o ku .       # local binary only
```

Building from source requires Go 1.26.3+. Running ku requires access to a
cluster. ku reads your default kubeconfig.

## Run

```
ku                       # current context, remembered namespace
ku --context my-ctx      # a specific context
ku -n kube-system        # start in a namespace
ku --resource deploy     # start on a resource type
ku --theme tokyonight    # use the Tokyo Night theme
ku --check               # read-only connectivity check, no UI
ku --version
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ku` | start the TUI |
| `ku config init` | write a starter config file with the built-in sidebar defaults |
| `ku config init --force` | overwrite the config file with the current defaults |
| `ku config path` | print the config file location |
| `ku upgrade` | download the latest release binary and replace the current binary |

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--context` | kubeconfig context to use (default: current-context) |
| `--kubeconfig` | path to the kubeconfig file (default: `$KUBECONFIG`, then `~/.kube/config`) |
| `-n`, `--namespace` | initial namespace; omit to use the remembered or context namespace |
| `--resource` | initial resource, e.g. `pods`, `deploy`, `svc` |
| `--theme` | `ansi` (default) or a built-in theme, e.g. `dracula`, `gruvbox`, `catppuccin` (see Themes) |
| `--check` | run a read-only connectivity check and exit |
| `--version` | print version and exit |

`--resource` accepts the same names as the in-app resource picker: plural,
singular, kind, short name, or group-qualified key such as
`scaledobjects.keda.sh`.

## Layout

ku opens on the cockpit, a cluster overview (health, node CPU/memory, pods,
deployments, and recent warnings). From there:

- A left nav lists Overview plus common resource kinds, grouped by category.
- The main area shows the cockpit or, once you pick a resource, its table with
  the same server-rendered columns as `kubectl get`.
- A status bar always shows the keys available right now, with the creator
  handle in the bottom-right.

Press `Tab` to move focus between the nav and the main area, `Enter` on a nav
entry to open it, and the Overview entry to return to the cockpit. The focused
pane has a highlighted border.

## Themes

The default `ansi` theme uses your terminal's own palette and adapts to a light
or dark background, so it matches whatever scheme you already run. ku also ships
37 fixed themes (Catppuccin, Dracula, Gruvbox, Nord, Rose Pine, Solarized, Tokyo
Night, and more), each with a light and dark variant chosen from your terminal
background. Pick one with `--theme <name>` or `KU_THEME=<name>`.

You can also switch live from inside the app: open the command palette
(`Ctrl+K`) and pick **Switch theme**. Navigating the list previews each theme in
place; the choice is remembered for the next launch, unless `--theme` or
`KU_THEME` is set (those still take precedence).

## Configuration

ku reads optional sidebar config from `~/.config/ku/config.yaml`. Use
`ku config init` to seed a starter file, then restart the TUI after edits.

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for file paths, sidebar examples,
resource names, and opt-in resources.

## Session memory

ku remembers the last context, namespace, and theme you used and restores them
on the next launch. Flags override the remembered values. State is written to
`~/.config/ku/state.json`.
