# Features

## Any resource, real columns

kli lists resources by asking the API server for the `Table` representation, the
same one `kubectl get` uses. Columns match what you expect for every kind,
including custom resources. Discovery builds the catalog and alias map (short
names like `po`, `deploy`, `svc`) at startup. If discovery is partial (an
aggregated API is down), kli warns instead of silently hiding kinds.

Jump anywhere with `:` (type a name or alias) or the `Ctrl+K` palette. The left
nav lists common kinds for quick access.

## Live tables

The table auto-refreshes every couple of seconds. `/` filters rows (the active
filter shows in the header and clears with `esc`). `w` toggles the wide columns
that `kubectl get -o wide` would show. Listing across all namespaces (`a`) adds a
NAMESPACE column.

## Describe and YAML

`Enter` or `d` opens the object's YAML in a scrollable view (managed fields
stripped). `g` / `G` jump to top and bottom. Secret `data` is base64-decoded
here for readability; editing a Secret still fetches raw base64 so saves stay
valid.

## Node stats

On the nodes view, kli appends live CPU and memory usage and percentages from
the metrics API, the same numbers as `kubectl top nodes`. This is best-effort:
if metrics-server is not installed, the columns are simply omitted.

## Edit, applied on save

`e` opens the object in `$EDITOR` (nvim, falling back to `vi`) in an overlay
inside the TUI. Save and quit to apply the change as an optimistic update; the
editor's cursor is rendered in the panel. If you make no changes, nothing is
sent. `Ctrl+\` cancels without applying. kli rejects edits that change the
object's kind or name.

## Logs

`l` on a pod streams logs live in an overlay (it prompts for the container when
there are several). `f` toggles auto-scroll so you can read back through
history; `g` / `G` jump to top and bottom.

## Shell into a pod

`s` on a pod opens an interactive shell in an overlay, run inside the TUI using
a virtual terminal. It runs `bash` if present, otherwise `sh`, over the cluster's
exec stream (WebSocket with SPDY fallback, like kubectl). `Ctrl+\` detaches; the
overlay also closes when you `exit`.

## Scale, restart, delete

`s` on a workload (deployment, statefulset, replicaset) prompts for a replica
count. `R` triggers a rolling restart of a deployment, statefulset, or daemonset
(the same restartedAt-annotation mechanism kubectl uses), after a confirm. `x`
deletes the selected object after a confirm.

The bottom bar is context-aware: it shows logs and shell for pods, scale and
restart for workloads, so the relevant actions are always in view.

## Namespaces and contexts

`n` picks a namespace, `a` toggles all-namespaces, and `c` switches context.
Switching context rebuilds the client, the resource catalog, and the left nav.
Your last context and namespace are remembered for next launch.
